# Heritage
Repository to showcase the source code from Heritage, a game made as a school project.

You can play the game here: https://chaos-production.itch.io/heritage

The source code is taken from an Unreal Engine 4.27 project.
This project was initially on P4V, I only transfered the source code.
I worked on this project alongside two other programmers as well as a team of artists.
I worked on just about everything, but I mostly worked in the following files:
-Every file in the Bird directory
-Game\KoGameState.cpp
-Order\KoFeatherOrder.cpp
-Player\KoPlayerCollector.cpp and Player\KoPlayerState.cpp
-Every file in Player\Interaction
